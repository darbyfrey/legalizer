== DESCRIPTION:

Legalizer is a simple API wrapper around the RightSignature document signature service.  It's still early in development, but you can:
* Find and get details on Contracts
* Search for available Templates
* Prepare and send a contract for signature

== EXAMPLES:

Establish a connection:

  legalizer = Legalizer({
    :oauth_key => 'YOUR OAUTH KEY', 
    :oauth_secret => 'YOUR OAUTH SECRET', 
    :access_token => 'YOUR ACCESS TOKEN', 
    :access_secret => 'YOUR ACCESS SECRET'
  })

List all available templates:

  legalizer.find.all_templates

List recently created contracts:

  legalizer.find.all_contracts

You can also find a contract by RightSignature's document id:

  legalizer.find.contract(id)

Or template id

  legalizer.find.template(id)

Sending is simplified right now, but will be enhanced later. For now you can just send a template to an email address with these parameters:

  template = legalizer.find.template(id)
  template.send('SUBJECT LINE', 'SENDERS NAME', 'SENDERS EMAIL','RECIPIENTS NAME','RECIPIENTS EMAIL','TAG')

== REQUIREMENTS:

* oauth
* json

== INSTALL:

* gem install leaglizer

== OAUTH

Getting this gem to work with OAuth is a little tricky right now, so I added a quick work around for the time being.  When you get your API access from RightSignature, they will supply you with an OAuth Key and an OAuth Secret. You will need to generate your own Access Token and Access Secret.  To do that, follow these steps:

In the console:

  Legalizer({
    :configure_oauth => true, 
    :oauth_key => 'YOUR OAUTH KEY', 
    :oauth_secret => 'YOUR OAUTH SECRET'
  })

You will get this response:

  Now visit: https://rightsignature.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=SOME_TOKEN

Visit that URL and grant your application access, you will be redirected to localhost, it doesn't matter if the page loads, just grab the oauth_verifier value from the URL string

Paste your oauth_verifier after the prompt and hit enter

  What's the value of `oauth_verifier`?

Then you'll get this response, and you're ready to go:

  Your access token is: YOUR ACCESS TOKEN
  Your access secret is: YOUR ACCESS SECRET
  Now you're ready to use these 2 values in your Legalizer configuration
